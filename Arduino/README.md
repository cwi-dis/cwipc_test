Not really only arduino.

Neopixelsync is a program that can be used to have a 16-pixel Neopixel strip flash a binary pattern in Gray Code, which changes every millisecond. Capturing this with multiple RGB cameras allows you to see whether the cameras are frame-accurately synced.

Detect_sync_signal will print out interval between rising pulses on GPIO 34. It can be used to detect the Realsense sync signal.
