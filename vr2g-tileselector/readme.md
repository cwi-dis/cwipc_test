# Helper files for tile selector debugging

These files are for the VR2Gather `PositionTracker.inputFile`.

Use `-1-sender` for the point cloud sender, player 1. It will move to the center of the scene (`Empty`, `Pilot 0`) and stay there.

Use the `-2-receiver` for the viewer, player 2. It will move around player 1, all the while looking at it.
