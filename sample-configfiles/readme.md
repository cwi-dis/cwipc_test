## cameraconfig.xml

Sample config file for two realsenses that are approximately on an equilateral triangle with the user, about 1.20m

to arcibo.local at cwi.

## cameraconfig-4cams.xml

Config file for the 4-camera setup in the large 3D room at CWI.

## cameraconfig-d435.xml

Config for a D435 about 1 meter away straight in front (i.e. on the top of a desktop screen).
