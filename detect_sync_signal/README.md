# ESP32 Pulse Detector

This folder contains a PlatformIO project with code to detect sync pulses
generated by a Intel Realsense depth camera using an ESP32-based Wemos Lolin32.

To set up the circuit, connect the Realsense's signal ground to one of the
ESP's ground pins and the SYNC pin to GPIO 34.

Plug the ESP into a computer via USB and start a serial monitor. Connect the
Realsense to a power source as well, configure it to be the sync master and
start the camera stream.

At this point you should be seeing some output on the serial monitor. For each
detected sync pulse on pin 34, the time in milliseconds since the last received
pulse is calculated and printed to the serial output. The acutual value depends
on the configured frame rate of the camera. For instance, for a frame rate of
25 FPS, you should be seeing pluse lengths of 40ms.
